vim_bells_and_whistles
======================

My .vim directory with a bunch of submodules and a vimrc that works with them

Clone this to ~/.vim

```
$ cd ~
$ git clone git@github.com:fbicknel/vim_bells_and_whistles.git .vim
```

Then expand all the submodules by using:

```
$ .vim/install
```

This will expand all the submodules and link your .vimrc to .vim/vimrc.  If
you have a .vimrc, it will be saved as vimrc_save.
